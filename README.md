## Project Overview
**This project was developed as part of my Engineering Thesis.** It is a specialized web-based application designed to automate calculations and documentation for **Strength of Materials** (Mechanical Testing). The tool streamlines the laboratory process, from data input to the final analysis of material properties.

## Key Features
* **Strength of Materials Suite:** Performs comprehensive analysis for various mechanical tests, including:
    * Static Tensile Test
    * Compression & Torsion Tests
    * Bending & Shear Analysis
* **Dynamic Visualization:** Automatically generates interactive **charts and stress-strain curves** based on the provided measurement data.
* **Automated PDF Reporting:** Features a built-in engine that creates professional laboratory reports. Users can **generate and download the final report as a PDF file** for archiving and technical documentation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **JavaScript:** Core logic for engineering algorithms and data processing.
* **HTML5 & CSS3:** For a responsive and clean User Interface (UI).
* **Chart Generation:** Implementation of JS libraries for real-time data visualization.
* **PDF Export:** Implemented via JavaScript libraries to handle automated report exporting.
* **GitHub Pages:** Deployment and hosting.
